Measurement Lab is an open platform for researchers to deploy Internet
measurement tools. By enhancing Internet transparency, M-Lab helps sustain a
healthy, innovative Internet.

m-lab.ops is a repository for code that is suited to operating the M-Lab
platform and experiments on M-Lab.

Directories:

 ci -- "continuous integration" a hook for integration testing with drone.io

 plsync -- synchronization scripts and configuration files for 
           mlab sites & slices

 tools -- command line tools of general use to operators for DRAC management,
          simple shell-script execution across all machines, and a command-line
          wrapper for interacting with the plcapi.

 slicebasemanager -- an early version of a work-in-progress for better 
          slice management.  This will be replaced with a more mature version.
