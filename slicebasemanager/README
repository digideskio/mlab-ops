The scripts in these sub-directories provide assistance with managing M-Lab
experiments.

OVERVIEW
========

There are three directories of interest:
    
    initscript --

        This directory contains a default initscript for slices running on
        M-Lab.  The initscript is part of the PlanetLab initscript mechanism.
        It will be installed as /etc/init.d/vinit.slice

        This script is installed in the slice at first creation.  It's purpose
        is to setup the local environment to support crond, rsyslog, and
        download, verify and install a minimal set of scripts for managing the
        installation of the actual slice image.

        On first invocation, it asserts some basic slice environment settings,
        i.e. crond is running, rsyslogd and then attempts to download the
        slice-manager package.

    smp --

        This directory is the slice manager package.  The slice manager installs
        some generic support services needed by all slices.  Specifically, it
        configures rsyncd, creates necessary directories, and installs generic
        script functions for use by experiment scripts.  
        
        The slice manager installs '/etc/init.d/slicectrl'.  slicectrl update
        checks for an experiment-specific package, downloads and installs it.

        TODO: add a random delay within the hour to avoid hitting central all at once.

    slice_example --

        This directory provides an minimal template for an experiment that will
        work with the slice manager.
